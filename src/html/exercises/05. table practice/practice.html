<!-- 
It's time to get some practice with all those table-related elements! (yikes)  
Your goal is to create a 3x3 table, with proper headings. 
(so it's really 4x3 if you count the heading cells)  
I've provided you with some starter data in index.html, though you do not have to use it.  
Just make sure you create a 3x3 table with a row of headings at the top, using the correct semantic elements. 
You are expected to use the following elements:

    table, 
    thead, 
    tr, 
    th, 
    tbody, 
    td

Here is what the table would look like with the starter data provided in index.html: -->


<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Subscription</th>
            <th>Price</th>
            <th>Support</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Free</td>
            <td>Free</td>
            <td>N/A</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Personal</td>
            <td>$9.99</td>
            <td>Weekdays</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Business</td>
            <td>$49.99</td>
            <td>24/7</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
