    <h1>Free Will</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        In the mind there is no absolute, or free, will; but the mind is determined to will this or that by a cause
        which is likewise determined by another, and this again by another, and so on to infinity.
    </p>
    <h2>What I am</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
        I do not know what I am: I am not what I know
    </p>
    <h3>Government</h3>
    <p>To be GOVERNED is to be watched, inspected, spied upon, directed, law-driven, numbered, regulated, enrolled,
        indoctrinated, preached at, controlled, checked, estimated, censured, commanded, by creatures who have neither
        the right nor the wisdom nor the virtue to do so.</p>
    <h3>God</h3>
    <p>God exists in such a manner that He cannot not exist; in fact, He exists necessarily; and He is not from something else.</p>
