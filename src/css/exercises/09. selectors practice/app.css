/* It's time to get some practice with the new CSS Selectors we just learned. Without touching any of the starter HTML code in index.html, write CSS in app.css according to these rules:

    Give all li elements the text color blue

    Give all elements with the class of done the text color grey

    Give the element with the id clear a red background and white text */

li {
    color: blue;
}

.done {
    color: grey;
}

#clear {
    background-color: red;
    color: #FFF;
}
