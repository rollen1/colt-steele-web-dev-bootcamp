/* Time for some basic CSS practice! I've provided you with some basic HTML markup in index.html, please don't touch it!  I've also made a styles.css file for you to work in.  Please style the elements according to these rules:

    h1s
         - green text
    h2s
         - magenta text
    paragraphs
        - white text
        - black background color
    buttons
    - red text
    - pink background color
    */

h1 {
    color: green;
}

h2 {
    color: magenta;
}

p {
    color: white;
    background-color: black;
}

button {
    color: red;
    background-color: pink;
}
